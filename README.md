# Spread spectrum watermarking and perceptually driven metrics on possible attacks

This paper/algorithm presents a revisited robust proposed watermarking scheme for RGB color images. We
strongly agree that the watermark should be selected from Gaussian random vector which is
independently identically distributed and should be inserted into the low frequency of the image which
increases the security of the watermark. In this way, any little attack at the low frequency will ensure
degradation of the image while will defeat the purpose of the attacker. Inserting the watermark in the
most perceptually significant part (low frequency) also ensure robustness against (lossy compression,
filtering etc).
We also explore the perceptual metrics to determine the level of degradation for each of the applied
attacks on the watermark. This helped us to know how the detector response with higher degradation.
Achieved results are provided to support our work.
